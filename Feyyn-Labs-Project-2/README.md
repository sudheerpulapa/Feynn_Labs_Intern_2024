# McDonald's Market Segmentation Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a project on market segmentation analysis for McDonald's.

## Notebook

The main analysis is presented in the Jupyter Notebook file:
- [McDonalds_Market_Segmentation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/sudheerpulapa/Feynn_Labs_Intern_2024/blob/main/Feyyn-Labs-Project-2/McDonalds_Market_Segmentation.ipynb)

## Project Structure

1. **Importing libraries**: Importing necessary Python libraries for the analysis.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Loading and exploring the dataset.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Exploring the data to understand its structure and characteristics.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing the data for further analysis.
5. **Applying Dimensionality Reduction Technique**: Utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality.
6. **K-Means Clustering Algorithm**: Implementing K-Means clustering for market segmentation.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis or explore the code, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `McDonalds_Market_Segmentation.ipynb` using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
3. Follow the instructions and execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
