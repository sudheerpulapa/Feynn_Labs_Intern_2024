## Introduction
This is Feynn Labs Internship's 3<sup>rd</sup> project. Here, we have to choose one best project of all our 1<sup>st</sup> projects.

Then need to do:
- Data collection
- Data analysis
- Machine learning
- Creating business model
- Creating finantial equation with the help of data analysis and machine learning. 
- If possible, we have to create app.

> We selected [**Machine Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Machines**](https://github.com/Adhiban1/Machine-Predictive-Maintenance) project

> Web App: [Link1](https://predictive-maintenance-tjaq.onrender.com/) (render.com) and [Link2](https://predictive-maintainances.uc.r.appspot.com/) (GCP)

## About

**Smart Industrial Predictive Solutions** is a forward-looking project with a big goal: to make industries smarter and more efficient. It does this by using fancy technology like data analysis and machine learning to predict when machines might break down. Imagine having a crystal ball that tells you when your car is going to have engine trouble before it even happens. That's what this project aims to do for factories and big machines in industries. By doing this, it helps companies save money, work more safely, and keep everything running smoothly. It's like having a super-smart maintenance team that never misses a beat!

## Project Evaluation Matrix for Feasibility, Viability, and Monetization

- **Feasibility:** Product/Service can be developed in short term future. (2-3 years)
- **Viability:** Product/Service should be relevant or able to survive in long term future. (20-30 years)
- **Monetization:** Product/Service should be monetizable directly. (indirectly monetizable Product/Service should be dropped for this Project)

> [Project-Assessment.md](Project-Assessment.md)

| Project Title                              | Feasibility (2-3 years) | Viability (20-30 years) | Monetization                   |

## Business Model
Real time Web Based monitoring and predictive maintenances app:

*prototype of real time web based predictive maintenance services*

```mermaid

A[Data collection\nthrough\nIOT based\nsensor]
B[Cloud\nstorage]
C[Data processing\nData checkup]
D[Analytics \n& Prediction]
E[Web based\napplication]

```

> [Business Model](documents/business_model2.pdf) is prepared by Karakavalasa venkata pranay and Shreyash Banduji Chacharkar

## ML Model ➡️ Web app

Yash Mayur's Machine Learning Model - [Github repo](https://github.com/ysmayur1992/predictive_maintenance)

Malay Vyas's Machine Learning Model - [Github repo](https://github.com/MalayVyas/Maintenance-Prediction)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
subgraph Data Scientist
A[(Dataset)] --Data Analysis-->B[Clean Dataset]
B --ML--> C[ML Model] --> D[Pickle file]
C --> E[ML Function]
end
subgraph Software Developer
E --> F[Web app]
D --> F
end
```

`ML Function` gets csv file of machines' data and returns failear dataframe of all machines.

```python
def ml_function(csv_path, model_path):
    # loading pre-trained model from model_path
    # pandas dataframe(df) from csv_path
    # df cleaning & preprocessing...
    ...
    ...
    # failear_df prediction from df using the ML model
    return failear_df
```

## Web app architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
A[Machines]
B[Front-end]
C[ML Function] 
E[ML-Model.pkl]
G[IOT]
H[Manual]

G --Machines data--> B

subgraph Web app
B --Machines data--> C
C--Failear Report--> B
E --> C
end

B --Failear report--> G

subgraph Industry

A --Data--> G
G --Repair--> A
H
end

A <--> H
H --database--> B
B --Failear Report--> H
```

## Upload csv format

|Type|Air temperature [K]|Process temperature [K]|Rotational speed [rpm]|Torque [Nm]|Tool wear [min]|Power|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
L|276|316|1244|15|192|29575|
H|333|302|1925|77|32|12799|
M|286|311|2678|80|50|15481|
|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|
H|338|301|2214|34|245|90977|

You can include extra columns for machine names or number but the above columns in the table must be there in your upload csv.

The report csv file has only failear machines data, for easily getting which machine is failear, another column called index is added in report csv.

## Web App Deployment

We deployed web app in GCP and render.com. Shreyash Banduji Chacharkar deployed web app in GCP [Github repo](https://github.com/ShreyashChacharkar/Predictive-maintainances). I deployed web app in render.com using [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/adhiban/smart-industrial-predictive-solutions) - `adhiban/smart-industrial-predictive-solutions:alpha`

## Gratitude for Exceptional Teamwork: A Journey with My Team

I wanted to express my heartfelt appreciation for the incredible support and expertise my team members have provided throughout this project. My team members' skills in data analysis and machine learning are truly exceptional, and I've had the opportunity to learn a tremendous amount from each member. This project has undoubtedly been the highlight of my team experiences, and I consider myself fortunate to have had the privilege of working with such an outstanding group. Although I've led teams for college projects in my native language, Tamil, I initially had some reservations about leading a team in English. However, working with my team members has been an absolute pleasure. My team members' effective communication and seamless collaboration have made this journey a joy, and I am genuinely grateful to have my team members as my partners in this endeavor. Thank you all so much for your hard work and dedication!
